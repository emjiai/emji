First, it revolutionized production methods through mechanization, shifting from hand production to machine manufacturing and creating factory systems that dramatically increased output. Second, it catalyzed urbanization as people migrated from rural areas to cities for factory jobs, leading to the rapid growth of urban areas and associated challenges like overcrowding and pollution. Third, it created new social classes, particularly an industrial working class (proletariat) and a wealthy industrial class (bourgeoisie), intensifying class divisions and laying the groundwork for labor movements. Additional impacts included transportation revolutions through railways and steamships, environmental deterioration from unchecked industrial pollution, and eventual improvements in living standards despite initial hardships for workers."
