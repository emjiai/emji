      "abstract": "Despite the common finding that crime is highly concentrated in space, the specific locations, characteristics, and contexts of crime hot spots are not consistently the same or generalizable across unique units of analysis and crime types. This dissertation will simultaneously integrate different types of environmental criminology predictors, including crime generators and attractors and environmental disorder indicators, to best identify the situational predictors of hot spot street segments relative to empirical controls in Indianapolis for several different crime types. Hot spot and control units will be compared based on the presence of spatially joined crime generators and attractors and environmental disorder indicators recorded via remote systematic social observation using Google Street View. In addition to uncovering the strongest environmental predictors significantly more likely to predict hot spots, this dissertation will also determine the level of spatial overlap of hot spots across different crime types and statistically assess the consistency of the influence of environmental predictors across each of the separate crime types. The findings will provide new information regarding the locations and composition of different types of crime hot spots at highly localized spatial extents. Also, this dissertation stands to make several methodological contributions by using remote systematic social observation to measure disorder and an innovative case-control research design that empirically matches hot spot and control units within a predefined spatial parameter while holding several key covariates constant",

      "abstract": "Our research was concerned with the geographical areas of Kent and Medway and involved the spatial and temporal analysis of \u2018heritage-specific offences\u2019, \u2018targeted heritage crime\u2019 and \u2018crime within, at or close to heritage sites\u2019. \nThe crime data consisted of offence type and location details for the 1,122,180 crimes recorded by Kent Police during the period under study.\nThe geographical data we utilised included locations of Conservation Areas, Listed Buildings, Scheduled Monuments, Registered Parks and Gardens, Registered Battlefields, World Heritage Sites, Protected Wreck Sites and \u2018Heritage at Risk\u2019 sites in Kent and Medway.\nOur best estimates suggest that currently approximately one in five Listed Buildings and one in four Places of Worship in Kent and Medway experience some form of crime each year. About one in ten Scheduled Monuments suffer crime, or it occurs nearby. Just over one half of Registered Parks or Gardens have one or more crimes a year within them. For Conservation Areas the proportion is (not unexpectedly) much larger, at closer to four in five.\nWe utilised local Moran\u2019s I to identify spatial clusters at a regional level using LSOA-level crime data. This revealed several LSOAs on the fringes of areas of high levels of crime that could be particularly vulnerable to the spread of crime and therefore heritage-specific locations within these areas could be managed to halt the \u2018spread\u2019 of crime towards the periphery of the town. \n In Kent and Medway Places of Worship (mostly Christian churches) are experiencing increasing numbers of crimes, and this has been particularly the case since around summer 2016. The rate of increase appears higher than that of all other crimes in the same period, both in general and at other heritage locations. \nThere is clear statistical evidence that metal thefts from churches have also been increasing markedly since around summer 2016. The rate of increase appears higher than that of most other crimes. There is statistically significant correlation between metal thefts from churches in Kent and Medway with both the price of lead and mixed brass.\nFinally, we discovered that machine learning as a method of heritage crime prevention shows promise",

      "abstract": "Based on a critical review of existing literature in the spatial-temporal analysis of crime, three challenges have been identified: spatial-temporal scaling, theorizing spatial patterns for different types of crime, and the micro interaction between space and time. The spatial-temporal scaling issue is related to choosing the appropriate geographic unit of analysis. The theoretical issue concerns the lack of an integrative approach that can integrate the benefits of each theoretical perspective and identify broader processes to explain the resulting spatial patterns for different types of crime. Also, examining and explaining the variation of the micro space-time interactions for different types of crime and their stability over time have received little attention. Therefore, this dissertation aims to 1) minimize the identified analytical issues resulting from the current practice of selecting the geographic unit of analysis, and 2) maximize/ complement the current theoretical and practical advantages for each theoretical perspective and practical policy. To achieve these two aims, this dissertation has threefold objectives: 1) to develop an analytical and empirical framework that facilities determine a reasonable spatial and temporal scale of analysis in crime, 2) to develop a theoretical framework that can explain the variation of spatial clustering and spatial scale in the first objective through an integrative theoretical approach of crime processes, and 3) to assess and explain the extent to which the micro space-time interactions and the temporal stability of the elevated risk for future crime vary across different types of crime. The results of the dissertation can inform criminological research on the spatial pattern of crime and the processes behind those patterns, and contribute to the development of more effective policies for crime control. Moreover, the empirical findings of the dissertation can reveal further practical implications by providing a systematic basis to demarcate the area to be searched in order to find an offender. Further analytical, theoretical, and practical implications of the findings are discussed",

      "abstract": "The distribution of incidents in time and space is a central issue in the study of crime, for both theoretical and practical reasons. It is also a context in which quantitative analysis and modelling has significant potential value: such research represents a means by which the implications of theory can be examined rigorously, and can also provide tools which support both policing and policy-making. The nature of the field, however, presents a number of challenges, particularly with regard to the incorporation of complex environmental factors and the modelling of individual-level behaviour. In this thesis, the techniques of complexity science are used to overcome these issues, and the approach is demonstrated using a number of examples from a range of crime types. The thesis begins by presenting a network-based framework for the analysis of spatio-temporal clustering. It is demonstrated that signature `motifs' can be identified in patterns of offending for burglary and maritime piracy, and that the technique provides a more nuanced characterisation of clustering than existing approaches. Analysis is then presented of the relationship between street network structure and the distribution of urban crime. It is shown that burglary risk is predicted by the graph-theoretic properties of street segments; in particular, those which correspond to levels of street usage. It is further demonstrated that the `near-repeat' phenomenon in burglary displays a form of directionality, which can be reconciled with a novel street network metric. These results are then used to inform a mathematical model of burglary, which is situated on a network and which may be used for prediction. This model is analysed and its behaviour characterised in terms of urban form. Finally, a model is presented for a contrasting crime problem, the London riots of 2011, and used to examine a number of policy questions",

      "abstract": "abstract: There has been a tremendous amount of innovation in policing over the last 40 years, from community and problem-oriented policing to hot spots and intelligence-led policing. Many of these innovations have been subjected to empirical testing, with mixed results on effectiveness. The latest innovation in policing is the Bureau of Justice Assistance's Smart Policing Initiative (2009). Created in 2009, the SPI provides funding to law enforcement agencies to develop and test evidence-based practices to address crime and disorder. Researchers have not yet tested the impact of the SPI on the funded agencies, particularly with regard to core principles of the Initiative. The most notable of these is the collaboration between law enforcement agencies and their research partners. The current study surveyed SPI agencies and their research partners on key aspects of their Initiative. The current study uses mean score comparisons and qualitative responses to evaluate this partnership to determine the extent of its value and effect. It also seeks to determine the areas of police agency crime analysis and research units that are most in need of enhancement. Findings indicate that the research partners are actively involved in a range of aspects involved in problem solving under the Smart Policing Initiative, and that they have positively influenced police agencies' research and crime analysis functions, and to a lesser extent, have positively impacted police agencies' tactical operations. Additionally, personnel, technology, and training were found to be the main areas of the crime analysis and research units that still need to be enhanced.

      "abstract": "The present study utilizes a novel approach to spatial crime analysis known as Risk Terrain Modeling (RTM) to assess the applicability of this technique in the prediction of predatory violent crime (homicide, aggravated assault, and pedestrian robbery). RTM provides a methodology for analyzing potential correlates of crime in a spatial context to identify specific locations at the highest risk for crime in the future. The intent of this process is to allow police and other community agencies to identify places at the highest risk for crime to allocate additional resources to stave off potential crime problems. The present study applies this technique to a metropolitan county near Atlanta, Georgia. RTM models were generated for each year from 2010 through 2014 based on several area characteristics including physical and social disorder, criminal elements, risky places, socioeconomic conditions, and area economic health. These models are then tested for their predictive validity and discrimination capabilities. The results indicate that the RTM methodology was successful in identifying many areas of risk for future crime, but was limited in the ability to accurately pinpoint areas at the highest risk of crime. The explained variance in the distribution of crime relative to risk was minimal and the RTM models incorrectly identified many places as high risk that were not subject to future crime while not identifying many areas that did experience crime. While this methodology shows promise on principle, more research is needed to improve performance of the RTM model prior to its use as a potential tool for crime prediction and intervention",

      "abstract": "Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI)As more and more datasets with self-exciting properties become available, the demand for robust models that capture contagion across events is also getting stronger. Hawkes processes stand out given their ability to capture a wide range of contagion and self-excitation patterns, including the transmission of infectious disease, earthquake aftershock distributions, near-repeat crime patterns, and overdose clusters. The Hawkes process is flexible in modeling these various applications through parametric and non-parametric kernels that model event dependencies in space, time and on networks.\r\nIn this thesis, we develop new frameworks that integrate Hawkes Process models with multi-armed bandit algorithms, high dimensional marks, and high-dimensional auxiliary data to solve problems in search and rescue, forecasting infectious disease, and early detection of overdose spikes.\r\nIn Chapter 3, we develop a method applications to the crisis of increasing overdose mortality over the last decade.  We first encode the molecular substructures found in a drug overdose toxicology report. We then cluster these overdose encodings into different overdose categories and model these categories with spatio-temporal multivariate Hawkes processes. Our results demonstrate that the proposed methodology can improve estimation of the magnitude of an overdose spike based on the substances found in an initial overdose. \r\nIn Chapter 4, we build a framework for multi-armed bandit problems arising in event detection where the underlying process is self-exciting. We derive the expected number of events for Hawkes processes given a parametric model for the intensity and then analyze the regret bound of a Hawkes process UCB-normal algorithm. By introducing the Hawkes Processes modeling into the upper confidence bound construction, our models can detect more events of interest under the multi-armed bandit problem setting. We apply the Hawkes bandit model to spatio-temporal data on crime events and earthquake aftershocks. We show that the model can quickly learn to detect hotspot regions, when events are unobserved, while striking a balance between exploitation and exploration. \r\nIn Chapter 5, we present a new spatio-temporal framework for integrating Hawkes processes with multi-armed bandit algorithms. Compared to the methods proposed in Chapter 4, the upper confidence bound is constructed through Bayesian estimation of a spatial Hawkes process to balance the trade-off between exploiting and exploring geographic regions. The model is validated through simulated datasets and real-world datasets such as flooding events and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) attack records. The experimental results show that our model outperforms baseline spatial MAB algorithms through rewards and ranking metrics.\r\nIn Chapter 6, we demonstrate that the Hawkes process is a powerful tool to model the infectious disease transmission. We develop models using Hawkes processes with spatial-temporal covariates to forecast COVID-19 transmission at the county level. In the proposed framework, we show how to estimate the dynamic reproduction number of the virus within an EM algorithm through a regression on Google mobility indices. We also include demographic covariates as spatial information to enhance the accuracy. Such an approach is tested on both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks. The results show that the Hawkes process outperforms several benchmark models published in a public forecast repository. The model also provides insights on important covariates and mobility that impact COVID-19 transmission in the U.S.\r\nFinally, in chapter 7, we discuss implications of the research and future research directions",

In this article we develop a penalized likelihood approach for introducing fairness into point process models of crime. In particular, we add a penalty term to the likelihood function that encourages the amount of police patrol received by each of several demographic groups to be proportional to the representation of that group in the total population. We apply our model to historical crime incident data in Indianapolis and measure the fairness and accuracy of the two approaches across several crime categories. We show that fairness can be introduced into point process models of crime so that patrol levels proportionally match demographics, though at a cost of reduced accuracy of the algorithms",

Smart cities of the future will need to leverage IoT, data analytics, and government and community human resources to most effectively reduce social harm. Currently, methods for collection, analysis, and modeling of heterogeneous social harm data to identify government actions to improve quality of life are needed. In this paper we propose a system, CDASH, for synthesizing heterogeneous social harm data from multiples sources, identifying social harm risks in space and time, and communicating the risk to the relevant community resources best equipped to intervene. We discuss the design, architecture, and performance of CDASH. CDASH allows users to report live social harm events using mobile hand-held devices and web browsers and flags high risk areas for law enforcement and first responders. To validate the methodology, we run simulations on historical social harm event data in Indianapolis illustrating the advantages of CDASH over recently introduced social harm indices and existing point process methods used for predictive policing",

      "abstract": "Many accurate spatiotemporal data sets have recently become available for research. Real-world applications create strong demands for a better multivariate point-process modeling. In this thesis, we develop new multivariate models with generalization ability and scalability. \tThe first two chapters provide a research background, real-world problems and a mathematical introduction to point-process models.\tIn chapter 3, we develop a nonparametric method for multivariate spatiotemporal Hawkes processes with applications on network reconstruction. In contrast to prior work, which has often focused on exclusively temporal information, our approach uses spatiotemporal information and does not assume a specific parametric form. Our results demonstrate that, in comparison to using only temporal data, our approach yields improved network reconstruction, providing a basis for meaningful subsequent analysis---such as examinations of community structure and motifs---of the reconstructed networks.\tIn chapter 4, we present a fast and accurate estimation method for multivariate Hawkes processes. Our method, with guaranteed consistency, combines two estimation approaches. Extensive numerical experiments, with synthetic data and real-world social network data, show that our method improves the accuracy, scalability and computational efficiency of prevailing estimation approaches. Moreover, it greatly boosts the performance of Hawkes process-based models on social network reconstruction and helps to understand the spatiotemporal triggering dynamics over social media.In chapter 5, we focus on multivariate spatial point processes, which can describe heterotopic data over space. However, highly multivariate intensities are computationally challenging due to the curse of dimensionality. To bridge this gap, we introduce a declustering-based hidden-variable model that leads to an efficient inference via a variational autoencoder (VAE). We also prove that this model is a generalization of the VAE-based model for collaborative filtering. This leads to an interesting application of spatial point-process models to recommender systems. Experimental results show the method's utility on both synthetic data and real-world data.\tFinally, in chapter 6, we show how multivariate point processes can be applied to opioid overdose events and real-time prediction of the hourly crime rate. In chapter 7, we discuss future directions and conclude the thesis",

The effectiveness of patrol operations heavily depends on the deployment of police officers \u2013 e.g., the number of officers assigned to specific policing districts or beats. The complex nature of the policing system \u2013 dynamic and stochastic criminal behavior, compounded with limited policing resources, render current (traditional) police operations, which are often managed in a reactive and stationary manner \u2013 often makes it very challenging to manage and control. This study develops an agent-based simulation framework to address the dynamically changing environment in police operations and provide a platform to study alternate police patrolling strategies. Moreover, this model is implemented to investigate the police patrol operation and improve its performance. A real-world case study was conducted to illustrate how this framework is used in dynamic patrol deployment planning.

Mathematical modeling has been used to model certain crimes and/or their phenomena. In addition, crime data analyses have been performed and used for crime prevention and control. In this study, we initially modeled crimes based on the concept of ???population biology.??? We cat-egorized crimes as felonies or misdemeanors and modified the changes in the population of each crime according to the characteristics of each offender, length of detention, recidivism rate, and arrest rate. We aimed to parameterize their characteristics and analyze the dynamics of the changes. In particular, we aimed to reflect the criminology theories of the ???broken window effect??? and ???crime school effect??? in our model. Through this modeling, we identified the equilibrium point and analyzed the stability of the equilibrium point when each effect was present. Then, we analyzed the phenomena according to the changes in the parameters related to the crimes and compared them with what was reflected in the real world using a bifurcation analysis. We then collected the criminal temporal and spatio-temporal data and used dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to analyze the important factors of each data type. Furthermore, we calculated the key factors through DMD, compared the characteristics obtained from the temporal and spatio-temporal data with those from the original data, and analyzed the relationships obtained from each characteristic.\n\nBased on the results of the crime dynamics, we concluded that misdemeanors must be considered to reduce the number of felonies from the perspective of police resources, as the aforementioned broken window effect and crime school effect are related to the dynamics of moving in and out of prison. We also analyzed the temporal and spatio-temporal criminal data using DMD. For the temporal data, we verified the predictions of the future states using DMD and the decay, growth, or oscillation of each type of crime. Moreover, we connected the DMD mode to crime hotspots and analyzed the environmental characteristics of the spatial factors.ope",

Predictive policing is, at the same time, one of the drivers of the birth, and the ultimate material enactment of, the anticipatory logics that are central to the smart city discourse. Quite surprisingly, however, critical analyses of the smart city have remained divorced from critical criminology and police studies. To fill this gap, this article sets out the first critical, in-depth empirical discussion of Blue CRUSH, a predictive policing program developed in Memphis (TN, U.S.A.), where its implementation intersects long-term austerity for urban policy. The article, first, shows that there is no evidence of Blue CRUSH\u2019s capacity to prevent crime, thus adding empirical material to skepticism over the role of predictive policing as a policy solution in the first place. And, second, it argues that, rather than making crime a matter of technological solutions, predictive policing shifts the politics therein\u2014in short, it contributes to the expansion of policing into the field of urban policy at the same time as it disrupts present police work. These takeaways allow to further the critique of the salvific promises implicit in the smart city discourse.info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio",

      "abstract": "Desde que John Snow analizara espacialmente los casos de c\u00f3lera de la epidemia de Londres de 1854, han sido muchas las disciplinas que se han beneficiado de la existencia de m\u00e9todos estad\u00edsticos espacio-temporales: agricultura, astronom\u00eda, biolog\u00eda, epidemiolog\u00eda, geolog\u00eda, hidrolog\u00eda, meteorolog\u00eda y teledetecci\u00f3n, entre otras. Esta tesis se centra en el desarrollo y aplicaci\u00f3n de estos m\u00e9todos en el contexto de dos disciplinas: la seguridad vial y la criminolog\u00eda. En particular, un objetivo capital ha sido el de detectar lagunas de investigaci\u00f3n en la literatura actualmente disponible. As\u00ed pues, la investigaci\u00f3n de diversos problemas que surgen de forma habitual en estas dos \u00e1reas, los cuales requieren de un tratamiento estad\u00edstico concreto, ha llevado a estructurar la tesis de la forma siguiente.\n\nEn primer lugar, tras un cap\u00edtulo introductorio, se exponen dos estudios sobre seguridad vial sobre una estructura de tipo red. As\u00ed pues, el Cap\u00edtulo 2 contiene un an\u00e1lisis multivariante a nivel de calle en el que se distingue entre zonas de intersecci\u00f3n y de no intersecci\u00f3n. Seguidamente, en el Cap\u00edtulo 3 se presenta un m\u00e9todo para la detecci\u00f3n de \u201chotspots\u201d de riesgo diferencial sobre una red.\n\nEl Cap\u00edtulo 4 incluye un an\u00e1lisis espacio-temporal de un conjunto de datos de robos a vivienda centrado en el fen\u00f3meno de casi-repetici\u00f3n, el cual es capital en criminolog\u00eda. La versi\u00f3n cl\u00e1sica del test de Knox es adaptada para contemplar la existencia de heterogeneidad espacio-temporal en el riesgo de robo, lo que permite obtener una visi\u00f3n m\u00e1s precisa de la magnitud del fen\u00f3meno. En concreto, se propone un ajuste adecuado en un contexto de ausencia de variaci\u00f3n espacio-temporal tanto en la variable exposici\u00f3n como en las covariables.\n\nEl Cap\u00edtulo 5 incluye un estudio detallado del problema de la unidad de \u00e1rea modificable (MAUP) en el contexto del an\u00e1lisis de la seguridad vial. Como novedad frente a estudios previos, la escala y la zonificaci\u00f3n de las estructuras espaciales son controladas de forma expl\u00edcita. Adem\u00e1s, el an\u00e1lisis no solo se centra en las consecuencias finales en t\u00e9rminos de estimaci\u00f3n y precisi\u00f3n de los modelos, sino en las alteraciones que sufren las variables.\n\nEl Cap\u00edtulo 6 se dedica a la comparaci\u00f3n de varias metodolog\u00edas que permiten analizar c\u00f3mo la proximidad a ciertos lugares influye en la incidencia de un evento de inter\u00e9s. En concreto, esta comparaci\u00f3n se realiza para valorar la relaci\u00f3n existente entre los accidentes de tr\u00e1fico y la localizaci\u00f3n de centros educativos. \n\nEl Cap\u00edtulo 7 se centra en analizar una cuesti\u00f3n a la que se ha dado gran importancia en criminolog\u00eda cuantitativa: la p\u00e9rdida de fiabilidad de un an\u00e1lisis como consecuencia de la presencia de eventos no geocodificados. Se ha estimado que alcanzar un 85% en la tasa de geocodificaci\u00f3n es lo suficientemente aceptable como para analizar los datos. En esta tesis se reestima este porcentaje teniendo en cuenta algunos factores y m\u00e9todos no tenidos en cuenta en la estimaci\u00f3n inicial. Se concluye que geocodificar el 85% de los eventos puede no ser suficiente bajo ciertas condiciones.\n\nFinalmente, el Cap\u00edtulo 8 incluye la descripci\u00f3n de dos paquetes de R que han sido desarrollados durante esta tesis: SpNetPrep, que permite el preprocesado y depuraci\u00f3n de una estructura de tipo red, y DRHotNet, que implementa el procedimiento de detecci\u00f3n de \u201chotspots\u201d descrito en el Cap\u00edtulo 3.Since physician John Snow analyzed the spatial distribution of cholera cases detected in the 1854 epidemic in London, many disciplines have benefited from the existence of spatio-temporal statistical methods: agriculture, astronomy, biology, epidemiology, geology, hydrology, meteorology, and remote sensing, among others. This thesis therefore focuses on the development and application of spatio-temporal methods in the context of two disciplines: traffic safety analysis and criminology. In particular, a capital objective has been to detect research gaps in the currently available literature. Thus, the investigation of several types of problems that usually arise in these two fields, which require a specific statistical approach, has led to the structuring of this thesis as follows.\n\nFirstly, after an introductory chapter, two studies in the context of traffic safety analysis where the use of a linear network structure is fundamental are shown. The first one contains a street-level multivariate analysis of the occurrence of traffic accidents accounting for the presence of intersection and non-intersection segments. Next, in Chapter 3, a method is presented and employed for the detection of differential risk \"hotspots\" along a network.\n\nChapter 4 includes a spatio-temporal analysis of a burglary dataset focused on the phenomenon of near-repetition, which is capital in the field of criminology. The classic version of the Knox test is adapted to account for spatio-temporal burglary risk heterogeneity, which provides a more accurate representation of the magnitude of the phenomenon. Specifically, an adjustment is proposed that is suitable in a context of absence of spatial-temporal variation in both the exposure variable and the covariates.\n\nChapter 5 includes a detailed study of the modifiable area unit problem (MAUP) in the context of traffic safety analysis. As a novelty compared to previous studies, the scale and zoning of the spatial structures considered are explicitly controlled. Furthermore, the analysis does not only focus on the final consequences in terms of estimation and precision of the models, but also on the alterations that occur in the different variables involved.\n\nChapter 6 is dedicated to the comparison of several methodologies that can be selected to analyze how the proximity to certain places influences the incidence of an event of interest. Specifically, this comparison is made to assess the relationship between traffic accidents and the location of educational centers. \n\nChapter 7 focuses on analyzing an issue that has been given great importance in quantitative criminology: the loss of reliability of analyses as a result of the presence of non-geocoded events. It has been estimated that reaching 85% geocoding success rate is enough to carry out further analysis of the data. In this thesis, this percentage is reestimated taking into account some factors and methods not taken into account in the initial estimation. It is concluded that reaching 85% success rate in the geocoding process may not be sufficient under certain conditions.\n\nFinally, Chapter 8 includes the description of two R packages that have been developed during this thesis: SpNetPrep, which allows the preprocessing and curation of a linear network, and DRHotNet, which implements the \"hotspot\" detection procedure described in Chapter 3",

      "abstract": "Smart city infrastructure has a significant impact on improving the quality of humans life. However, a substantial increase in the urban population from the last few years poses challenges related to resource management, safety, and security. To ensure the safety and security in the smart city environment, this paper presents a novel approach by empowering the authorities to better visualize the threats, by identifying and predicting the highly-reported crime zones in the smart city. To this end, it first investigates the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) to detect the hot-spots that have a higher risk of crime occurrence. Second, for crime prediction, Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) is exploited in each dense crime region to predict the number of crime incidents in the future with spatial and temporal information. The proposed HDBSCAN and SARIMA based crime prediction model is evaluated on ten years of crime data (2008-2017) for New York City (NYC). The accuracy of the model is measured by considering different time scenarios such as the year-wise, (i.e., for each year), and for the total considered duration of ten years using an 80:20 ratio. The 80% of data was used for training and 20% for testing. The proposed approach outperforms with an average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 11.47 as compared to the highest scoring DBSCAN based method with MAE 27.03",

      "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed an explosion of interest in predictive policing, with a clear opposition emerging between supporters and critics of its implementation. While critical accounts conventionally centre on opacities and operational asymmetries of the algorithmic construct (biased training, feedback loop, etc.), I argue that a different critique is first needed. Focussing on place-based techniques, I maintain that contemporary predictive mapping basically perpetuates the political and epistemic dictates which have historically framed the conceptualisation of crime in relation to space. Through a review of sources spanning from the Cartographic School to current predictive policing literature, I identify two main conceptual axes which operationalise this heritage: first, an explanatory framework of crime that has never detached from the socio-economic deficit archetype; and secondly, an ontologisation of crime alternative to biologicist positivism, nonetheless integral to the etiologic paradigm. Therefore, without first disputing these ideological bottlenecks, no initiative towards a transparent use of predictive policing is plausible, neither does a sharp distinction between place-based and person-based predictions seem tenable.</p",
