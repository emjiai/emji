It builds on two major  ideas already tested in crime forecasting. The first is crime-data-only analysis, which  uses just past crime records to find patterns and predict future crimes. Tools like PredPol  and studies like Mohler et al. have shown that crimes often repeat in similar areas shortly  after they happen. The second is multi-source modeling, where additional data such as  population statistics, points of interest like bars or train stations, and even weather are  added to improve predictions. While some studies (like those by Bowen et al., Castro et  al., and Marchant et al.) have shown that multi-source models can perform better than  crime-only models, these were mostly done in controlled research settings and have not  yet been tested using operational police data.

      "summary": "## Cross-Crime-Type Predictive Models: Influence Across Space and Time\n\n**Predictive policing** leverages data analytics and mathematical models to forecast when and where crimes are likely to occur, allowing law enforcement to deploy resources more efficiently[1][2][4]. A cross-crime-type predictive model specifically investigates how different crime types (e.g., burglary, assault) might influence each other over time and geographic space.\n\n## Decision-Making in Predictive Policing\n\nPredictive policing models generate actionable insights that guide law enforcement decision-making and task prioritization. By analyzing spatial-temporal crime patterns—including correlations between different crime types—these models help agencies:\n\n- Identify emerging hotspots where interrelated crimes may cluster[4].\n- Allocate limited resources to areas or times with the highest predicted risk, improving efficiency and effectiveness[1][4].\n- Schedule patrols or interventions more strategically, often in real time, to prevent escalation or recurrence of related crimes[4].\n\nFor example, if a pattern shows that property crimes often precede violent offenses in a given neighborhood, officers may intensify patrols or community engagement following a surge in property crime, aiming to disrupt the sequence.\n\n## Task Performance Analysis\n\nThe effectiveness of predictive policing, particularly with cross-crime-type models, is evaluated by analyzing:\n\n- The accuracy of predicting not just isolated crime events but also sequences and interactions between different crimes over time[3][5].\n- The impact on crime rates and types after interventions are deployed based on model predictions[2].\n- Officer response times and resource allocation effectiveness compared to traditional, non-predictive methods[1][4].\n\nSuch performance metrics help determine if predictive approaches actually reduce overall crime or simply shift incidents geographically or temporally.\n\n## Cross-Crime Influences: Theoretical Foundation\n\nResearch has shown that certain crimes can act as triggers for others, a concept reflected in \"aftercrime\" patterns—similar to aftershocks following earthquakes[4]. For example:\n\n- A spike in burglaries may increase the risk of subsequent robberies or assaults nearby.\n- The location and timing of one crime event can elevate the chance of related crimes occurring in the same vicinity shortly after[4].\n\nPredictive models capable of capturing these interactions enable proactive policing strategies aimed at preventing crime cascades rather than responding to isolated incidents.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCross-crime-type predictive models enhance both decision-making and task performance in policing by:\n\n- Revealing how different crimes influence each other across space and time.\n- Supporting data-driven deployment of resources.\n- Improving the ability to preempt and prevent reinforced crime patterns[1][2][4][5].\n\nBy integrating complex behavioral patterns into their algorithms, these tools represent a significant advancement over traditional policing, offering the potential for more effective crime prevention and public safety outcomes.",
